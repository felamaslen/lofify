# @lofify/backend

The TypeScript monolith. Hosts the GraphQL API, the playback HTTP
endpoint, the library scanner, and the database schema + migrations.

## Layout

```
src/
  app.ts        buildApp(): Fastify with /healthz, /graphql,
                /graphql/stream. No listener bound — used by tests.
  config.ts     Static code-level constants (chunk duration, etc.).
  graphql/      GraphQL schema (grats source) and resolvers.
  db/           Drizzle schema, migrations, and shared pg pool.
  scanner/      Library scan + chokidar watcher (in-process). A scan
                walks every library root, classifies discovered files
                against `Tracks` in batches, and feeds a priority queue:
                new files are parsed first, changed files next, and
                unchanged files are skipped.
  playback/     `/play/...` HTTP route, HMAC-signed URLs, unified
                per-entry encoded cache (.bin + .idx live-tail), and
                ffmpeg encoder.
  test/         Vitest behavioural tests driven by fastify.inject.
```

## Scripts

| Script               | What it does                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`                | `tsx watch src/index.ts` — boots the server             |
| `start`              | Production-style boot (no watch)                        |
| `test`               | `vitest run` (behavioural tests via fastify.inject)     |
| `typecheck`          | `tsc --noEmit`                                          |
| `codegen`            | All code generators (`db:generate`, `gql:generate`)     |
| `db:generate`        | Drizzle schema → `src/db/__generated__/schema.sql`      |
| `gql:generate`       | grats → `src/graphql/__generated__/schema.{ts,graphql}` |
| `db:migrate`         | Apply pending migrations                                |
| `db:migrate:create`  | Diff schema vs. applied migrations, write new SQL       |
| `db:migrate:list`    | Show migration history                                  |
| `db:migrate:pending` | Show pending migrations                                 |

## Adding a migration

```sh
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate:create --name <descriptive_name>
pnpm db:migrate
```

The Drizzle schema is the single source of truth — there is no journal.
`create` diffs the desired schema against a throwaway DB built from the
existing migrations.

## Schema conventions

- Document every column/table with JSDoc unless the purpose is obvious
  from the name. No newlines inside JSDoc except to separate paragraphs.
- Tables use PascalCase identifiers (e.g. `Tracks`); columns use
  camelCase.
- Primary keys: `uuid` with `default uuidv7()` (built into Postgres 18).

## GraphQL

The schema is derived from TypeScript via [grats](https://grats.capt.dev/).
Mark roots with `@gqlQueryField` / `@gqlMutationField`, types with
`@gqlType`, and run `pnpm gql:generate` to refresh
`src/graphql/__generated__/`. `nullableByDefault` is off, so the
TypeScript return type determines schema nullability — per project
convention, mutations return non-null (`T`) and queries return nullable
(`T | null`).

The `@constraint(min, max)` directive on argument definitions is
enforced at runtime by `applyConstraintDirective` (called from
`buildSchema`). Out-of-range values fail with `BAD_USER_INPUT` before
the resolver runs.

## Tag overrides

Each editable tag on `Tracks` (`title`, `trackNumber`, `discNumber`,
`artist`, `album`, `year`) has a nullable `*Override` sibling column.
`Mutation.trackUpdate(id, ...)` writes the supplied tags to those
override columns; omit an argument to leave its override untouched, or
pass an explicit `null` to clear it. The scanner only writes the base
columns, so overrides survive rescans. Every read (`Query.track`,
`Query.tracks`, including the pagination sort) returns the effective
value, `coalesce(override, scanned)`.

## Endpoints

- `GET /healthz` — liveness probe; returns `{ "status": "ok" }`.
- `POST /graphql` — Apollo Server over Fastify (queries + mutations).
- `POST /graphql/stream` — GraphQL subscriptions over SSE via
  [`graphql-sse`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse)
  (distinct-connections mode). Send a `subscription` operation with
  `Accept: text/event-stream`.

### Playback

`GET /play/:signature/c:<container>/a:<codec>/q:<min|l|m|h|max>/:id`

Range-based playback over a single encoded `.bin` per `(track,
container, codec, quality)`. The URL bakes a **fully-resolved** target
(container + codec + quality) rather than the client's request — format
resolution depends on client capabilities the stateless route never
sees, so it runs once in `Track.url`/`Track.delivery` and the route just
decodes the result. The URL is HMAC-signed with
`PLAYBACK_SIGNING_SECRET` (signature covers `c:.../a:.../q:.../id`);
clients send `Range: bytes=START-END` (or `bytes=START-`) and the server
slices the `.bin`. `HEAD` returns `Content-Type` + `Accept-Ranges`, plus
`Content-Length` once the encode is complete.

**Format resolution** (`resolve.ts`) maps a client `TrackFormat` —
preference-ordered `losslessFormats` / `lossyFormats` MIME lists plus a
`quality` — to that concrete target, copying without re-encoding
whenever possible:

| `quality`                   | source   | served as                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAX`                       | lossless | first supported `losslessFormats` entry — `audio/mp4; codecs="flac"` (copy for flac, re-encode otherwise)                                                |
| `MAX`                       | lossy    | first `lossyFormats` entry whose codec matches the source (a **copy**: vorbis→webm, opus→mp4/webm, mp3→mp3); else transcode to the first encodable entry |
| `MIN`/`LOW`/`MEDIUM`/`HIGH` | any      | transcode to the first `lossyFormats` entry the server can encode (opus or mp3) at the preset bitrate                                                    |

Each target maps to one cache entry under
`PLAYBACK_CACHE_DIR/<trackId>-<sourceMtimeMs>/<targetKey>.{bin,idx}`
(`targetKey` includes the container, so `mp4/opus` and `webm/opus` don't
collide). The `.bin` is what the route streams from; the `.idx` is a
live-updating JSON manifest (chunk byte ranges + cumulative
`endSeconds`) maintained by `live-tail.ts` as ffmpeg writes.

The chunk layout depends on the container — fragmented mp4 (`moof` +
`mdat` fragments) for opus/flac, WebM (`Cluster` elements) for
opus/vorbis, raw mp3 frame stream for mp3 — each with its own
`Scanner` (`scan-mp4`/`scan-webm`/`scan-mp3`), but the route doesn't
care; it slices bytes. A "copy" is always a container remux (e.g.
Vorbis-in-Ogg → Vorbis-in-WebM): the codec packets are untouched but the
output bytes differ from the source, so the remuxed `.bin` is still
generated and cached. Up to `TRANSCODE_MAX_PARALLEL` ffmpeg encodes run
concurrently.

`Track.delivery(format)` returns the resolved `{ url, mimeType,
isPassthrough, description }` in one field, so a client gets the
SourceBuffer MIME type and a tooltip-ready description without a probe
request.

### Manifest subscription

`subscription trackManifest(trackId, format: TrackFormat)` — streams
manifest snapshots throttled to ~1 Hz: chunk count, cumulative
duration, per-chunk `{ byteStart, byteEnd, endSeconds }`, optional
init segment range, and a `done` flag. Clients use it to discover
which byte ranges to ask the playback route for, and to map seek
times to chunks. Already-warm cache entries emit a single `done:
true` snapshot and complete.
